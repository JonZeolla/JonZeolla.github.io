# Reporting Security Issues

Please disclose security concerns responsibly.

If you believe you've found a security bug (an unsafe recommendation, a vulnerable code sample, etc.) in this project,
please contact me and include the word "vulnerability". If you believe you've found a security bug in a third-party
project used by our projects, please report it to those those maintainers.
