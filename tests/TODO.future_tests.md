# Future testing improvements

1. Allow testing a specific lab instead of all of them. `task test -- policy-as-code`
1. Improve the cleanup/teardown to be more pytest native.
1. Add tests inline, hidden in the labs. Extract and then run them interleaved with the visible code blocks.
1. Allow the region to be specified when testing.
